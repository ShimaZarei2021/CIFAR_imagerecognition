# CIFAR-Imageprocessing
In this project the Recurrent neural network(RNN), recursive RNN, Convolutional neural network(CNN) and recursive CNN are implemented and the result is compared with each other ignorer to find the best methods of classification.
In this project libreries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Tensorboard and Sklearn are used.
